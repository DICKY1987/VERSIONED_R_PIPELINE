# ACMS Documentation Operating Contract

## Purpose

This operating contract codifies the governance rules for all documentation produced during the Autonomous Code Modification System (ACMS) program. It operationalizes the principles described in the executive summary and the build execution contract—determinism, observability, isolation, safety, and test-driven development—for written artefacts.

## Scope

- Applies to every file in the `docs/` and `plans/` directories as well as any Markdown content delivered through MkDocs.
- Covers authoring, reviewing, approving, and publishing activities executed by humans or AI agents.
- Interfaces with CI/CD enforcement workflows (`docs-guard` and `doc-tags`) defined in the supplemental development plan.

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Platform.Engineering** | Owns this contract, approves structural changes, and maintains MkDocs configuration. |
| **AI Implementation Agents** | Generate documentation drafts, ensure front matter compliance, and trigger validation scripts. |
| **Compliance** | Audits versioning metadata, confirms traceability, and ensures retention policies align with `VERSIONING_OPERATING_CONTRACT.md`. |
| **Operations** | Validates that published docs map to deployed capabilities and that rollback procedures are documented. |

## Documentation Workflow

1. **Authoring**
   - Begin from a scoped work item with a ULID trace ID.
   - Draft content in Markdown with required YAML front matter.
   - Reference source documents (execution contracts, guides) with inline citations.
2. **Validation**
   - Run `python scripts/generate_docs.py --strict` to build MkDocs output locally or in CI.
   - Ensure linting, testing, and security checks pass as defined in `ACMS_BUILD_EXECUTION_CONTRACT.yaml` success gates.
3. **Review and Approval**
   - Submit changes via Pull Request with documentation impact summary.
   - Assign Platform.Engineering as reviewer; Compliance reviews when `contract_type` is `policy` or `execution_contract`.
4. **Release**
   - Merge only after CI succeeds.
   - Tag documentation releases following semantic versioning rules.

## Quality Gates

- **Front Matter Validation** – All fields defined in `VERSIONING_OPERATING_CONTRACT.md` must be present and valid.
- **Deterministic Builds** – `mkdocs build` output must be reproducible given identical inputs and environment.
- **Traceability** – Documentation updates must link to ledger entries and Jaeger traces when generated by automated agents.
- **Security** – No secrets, tokens, or sensitive configuration snippets may appear in docs. Use `gitleaks` for enforcement.

## Observability and Audit Trail

- Every documentation build must emit a JSONL ledger record containing ULID, git commit, MkDocs version, and status.
- CI workflows must push OpenTelemetry traces labeled with `component=docs` so that documentation lifecycle can be audited end-to-end.

## Maintenance

- Reassess this contract at least quarterly or when major process changes occur.
- Increment `semver` in accordance with the Versioning Operating Contract when updates are made.
- Archive superseded versions under `/docs/archive/` with `status: deprecated` when replaced.

## Non-Compliance Handling

- **Minor Violations** (e.g., missing link, outdated reference): Address within the same sprint; treat as PATCH release.
- **Major Violations** (e.g., missing front matter, invalid version bump): Block merge until remediated; may require MINOR release with corrective actions.
- **Critical Violations** (e.g., security leakage, deterministic failure): Trigger incident response, revert affected documentation, and escalate to Compliance immediately.
